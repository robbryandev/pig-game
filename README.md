## Description

Pig Dice! But what is Pig Dice? How did it come about? No one knows. Don't fact check us. But we can tell you how to play.

Pig Dice is played with, traditionally, two players and one die. The first player to _100_ wins, but there are stipulations. If you roll your six sided die and get anything from TWO to SIX you can either roll again, adding the die together as many times as you'd like...UNLESS: If you roll a ONE you ose the score of all the die you rolled on this turn.

You do have the option to pass at any time, saving the total of the die rolled on this turn into your total and passing the die to your opponent. Give it a try!

You have your choice of multiplayer OR two levels of difficulty in single player mode. Good luck!
